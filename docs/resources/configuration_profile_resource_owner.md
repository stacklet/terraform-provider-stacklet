## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = stacklet_configuration_profile_resource_owner.example
  id = "ignored" # the resource ID is ignored since it's global
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import stacklet_configuration_profile_resource_owner.example ''  # the resource ID is ignored since it's global
```
