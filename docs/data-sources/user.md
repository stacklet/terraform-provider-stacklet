# stacklet_user (Data Source)

Retrieve information about a user by username or email. Exactly one of username or email must be specified. This data source provides the role_assignment_principal attribute needed for role assignments.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Fetch user information by email
data "stacklet_user" "by_email" {
  email = "user@example.com"
}

# Or fetch user information by username
data "stacklet_user" "by_username" {
  username = "username"
}

# Use the role_assignment_principal for role assignments
output "user_principal" {
  value = data.stacklet_user.by_email.role_assignment_principal
}

# Output user details
output "user_name" {
  value = data.stacklet_user.by_email.name
}

output "user_roles" {
  value = data.stacklet_user.by_email.roles
}
```
